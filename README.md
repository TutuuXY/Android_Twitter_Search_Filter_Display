Android_Twitter_Search_Filter_Display
=================================

Finish Data: March 2010

Android app. Used the Twitter API to pull tweets from Twitter and display them in a list View. The user's Twitter photo, handle and location should be displayed alongside the tweet. Built a simple search box that filters tweets based on user location. For example if you enter 'New York' in the search box, it should display users from New York. 

Implement a light weight persistent data store like sqlite.

Back, Next buttons provided for review filter history.
